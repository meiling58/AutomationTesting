# Overview
This repo using VScode to setup all automation testing.
- Local setup:
1. Install VScode
2. Install Python
3. Install Java
4. Open VScode and adding extensions:
   - Python Extension: For robot framework automation testing
   - Robot Framework Language Server Extension: For robot framework automation testing
   - 
## Automation Testing
Automation Testing means using specialized software tools and scripts to automatically execute test cases.
## Automation Testing Tools/Software
Popular tools include Selenium, Appium, Cypress, Playwright, LambdaTest, Cucumber, Katalon Studio, TestComplete, Tricentis Tosca, Postman, Ranorex, Robot Framework, ACCELQ, Eggplant, Apache JMeter, Applitools, Jest, Perfecto, Puppeteer, TestNB, Parasoft, leapwork
|  Tool  |  Definition   |
|--------|---------------|
|Selenium|Java, Python, JavaScripts|
|Robot Framework| Python|
|Cypress|Real-Time reloading, Automatic waiting, Deep Debugging Capabilities, only testing JavaScripts|
|Appium|Mobile testing, Android and ISO |
|Puppeteer |Web Scraping, automated UI Testing, Performance Analysis|
### Automation testing frameworks
Selenium, Cypress, robot
### Automation Testing Types
|    Test Type     |          Definition             |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Unit              |test the samallest piece of code, during the development of the app |
|Health/Smoke      |test the software is stable or not, before the release |
|Confidence/Sanity |test the individual software components, checks the specified functional |
|Performance       |test the system performs stable and responsiveness under a particular load |
|Regression        |test the software still works fine after code change  |
|Integration/Functional| smiliar the Confidence/Sanity   |
|Acceptance Testing|Final tests to determine what degree the applications meets end users' approval |
|API Testing       |Test the functionality, security, and reliability of APIs  |
|UI Testing        |Test all fields, buttons, and other items on the screen function as desired |
## Goals for Automation Testing
|        Expected          |         Benefits        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|Automated Execution       |Faster Feedbak           |
|Efficiency and Speed      |Cost Savings             |
|Reduced Human Error       |Increased Reliability    |
|Improved Test Coverage    |Best Test Coverage       |
|Early Bug Detection ||
|Resuability| |
## What tests need to be automated
|  Test Type |  Definition |
|------------|-------------|
|Monotonous test |Tests can be automated for further use in the future |
|Multiple data sets|Extensive tests that require multiple data sets can be automated|
|Business critical tests|High-risk business critical test cases can be automated and scheduled to run regularly|
|Determinant test |test cases where it is easy for the computer to decide whether the test has failed or not can be automated|
|Tedious test|Test cases repeatedly doing the same action can be automated so that the computer can do the repetitive task as humans are very poor at performing the repetitive task with efficiency, which increases the chances of error|
